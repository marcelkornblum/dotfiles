Settings
========

A place to keep hard-to-remember app and system settings for my personal setup. Much cribbed from
various dotfiles repos and blogs.

There's a branch per distro, mainly OS X.

Clone this into a subfolder of your $HOME, create a CONFIG file inside it (use the CONFIG.template),
and then `cd bin` and `./create-symlinks` which will make symlinks in you $HOME of the files in
this repo, being careful not to overwrite anything (thanks
