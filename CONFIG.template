# This is the config to know:
# 1- which files should simply be ignored
# 2- which files (more precisely, directories) should have their children
#    symlinked instead of themselves (e.g. for a directory like .config/foo, you
#    don't want to symlink .config directly in ~/ because it is probably used by
#    other applications. Instead, you want to symlink .config/foo inside
#    ~/.config)
# 3- all the other files will be symlinked directly in the home

# Ignore these
cfg_ignore=("CONFIG" "CONFIG.example" "README.md" "bin" "todo"   # This repo
    ".git" ".gitignore" ".gitmodules"   # Git
    "*.orig" "*.rej"            # Patch residues
    ".*.swp" "*~" "\#*\#"           # Vim/Emacs
    ".DS_Store"             # Mac
    "tags" "TAGS")              # CTags

# the dotfiles directory is located at the given value relative to
# cfg_dest_dir.
# E.g: If cfg_dest_dir is /home/foo and the dotfiles directory is in
# /home/foo/git/dotfiles, then you should put "git/dotfiles" in there.
